# Notes about zsh

# Color themes in omzsh
Nice features:
sporty_256 got the name to the right.
tjkirch got the time to the right

smt also has a lot of nice info

sonicradish, too simple

- Set theme with `omz theme <theme-name>`


# Old stuff

- Using zsh with oh-my-zsh
https://ohmyz.sh/#install

- Using the theme `agnoster` with oh-my-zsh

- Install special font first:

`sudo apt-get install fonts-powerline`

Or this instead so it works with Ubuntu
https://github.com/powerline/fonts/releases/tag/2015-12-04
